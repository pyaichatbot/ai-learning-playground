# Advanced Mode – Landing Screen Copy & UX Intent

## Purpose
The Advanced Mode landing screen exists to **reframe expectations**, not to sell features.
It signals a shift from exploration to judgment.

This screen must make the user pause and consciously opt into constraint-driven thinking.

---

## Positioning Statement (Primary)

### Title
**Advanced Mode**

### Subtitle
**System-level insight under real constraints**

### Framing Copy (Hero Text)
> Advanced Mode is designed for professionals who want to understand how AI systems actually behave in production environments.
>
> It does not optimize prompts.
> It does not offer shortcuts.
> It reveals limits, trade-offs, and failure modes.

This copy must be calm, confident, and non-marketing.

## Explicit Contrast Section

### Heading
**How this differs from Basic Mode**

### Copy
- Basic Mode is exploratory and flexible.
- Advanced Mode is opinionated and constrained.
- Basic Mode encourages experimentation.
- Advanced Mode enforces system realities.

End with:
> If you are looking for tips or automation, stay in Basic Mode.

This sentence is intentionally filtering.

## What Advanced Mode Gives You

### Section Title
**What you will gain**

### Bullet Points
- A clear view of context limits and truncation behavior
- Insight into instruction dilution and ambiguity
- Early visibility into cost and scale implications
- A system-first perspective on prompt failures

Avoid words like:
- “Improve”
- “Boost”
- “Optimize”
- “Best practices”

---

## What Advanced Mode Will Not Do

### Section Title
**What this mode intentionally avoids**

### Bullet Points
- Automatic prompt rewriting
- AI-generated recommendations
- Step-by-step guidance
- Feature overload

Follow with:
> Understanding comes before optimization.

---

## Entry Call-to-Action

### Button Label
**Enter Prompt Reality Cockpit**

### Microcopy Below Button
> You can return to Basic Mode at any time.

This reduces commitment anxiety.

---

## Monetization Signaling (Future-Safe)

### Hidden / Secondary Copy (Not Prominent)
> Advanced Mode may include paid features in the future.
> Early access will always prioritize learning over monetization.

This should not feel like a paywall tease.
