# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## AI Learning Playground

## 1. Purpose
The AI Learning Playground is designed to help practitioners **understand how AI systems behave under real-world constraints**, not to teach syntax or provide tutorials.

The product prioritizes **judgment, constraints, and system behavior** over optimization or automation.

---

## 2. Product Vision
> Where AI concepts become interactive system-level experiences.

---

## 3. User Personas
- Senior Engineers
- Architects
- Tech Leads
- Engineering Managers
- Advanced AI Practitioners

---

## 4. Product Modes
The Playground consists of two modes:

### 4.1 Basic Mode (Current)
- Exploratory
- Open-ended
- Educational
- Free forever

### 4.2 Advanced Mode (Future, Monetizable)
- Opinionated
- Constraint-driven
- System behavior focused
- Cockpit-based learning

---

## 5. Core Principles
- Insight over output
- Constraints over flexibility
- Explanation over optimization
- Confidence and curiosity as primary outcomes

---

## 6. Scope (Advanced Mode)
Included:
- Cockpit-based experiences
