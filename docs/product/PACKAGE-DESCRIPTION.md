## ✨ One-Liners to Remember

> "Understanding happens at the intersection of theory and observable reality."

> "The difference between a working agent and a broken one is often one bad decision in a 20-step chain. Visualization makes that visible."

> "Understanding isn't memorizing patterns—it's seeing them in action, breaking them, rebuilding them better."
